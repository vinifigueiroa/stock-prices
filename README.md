UoPeople Programming Assignment (CS1102)

## Assignment Description

This assignment will assess your skills and knowledge in Implementing array and ArrayList traversal using loops and analyzing the time and space complexities of algorithms involving these data structures.

**Context**:  You are working on a data analysis project where you need to process an array of opening stock prices containing 10 days of data as float datatype. Additionally, you need to analyze the time and space complexities of these algorithms to ensure efficient processing.

***Consider a scenario where you have been given an array of integers representing the daily stock prices of a company for a given period. You are also provided with an ArrayList of stock prices for the same period.* Write the code for the below mentioned tasks, including the required methods, and their implementations.**

You are required to implement a program that performs the following tasks:

1. **Calculate the average stock price:**
    - Write a method, calculateAveragePrice, that takes the array of stock prices as input and returns the average price of the stocks. Interpret and justify the time complexity of your algorithm for both array and ArrayList traversal.
2. **Find the maximum stock price**:
    - Write a method, findMaximumPrice, that takes the array of stock prices as input and returns the maximum price among all the stocks. Predict the time complexity of your algorithm for both array and ArrayList traversal and validate it by analyzing the implementation.
3. **Determine the occurrence count of a specific price**:
    - Write a method, countOccurrences, that takes the array of stock prices and a target price as input and returns the number of times the target price occurs in the array. Summarize the space complexity of your algorithm for both array and ArrayList traversal and validate it.
4. **Compute the cumulative sum of stock prices**:
    - Write a method, computeCumulativeSum, that takes the ArrayList of stock prices as input and returns a new ArrayList containing the cumulative sum of prices at each position. Incorporate and justify the space complexity of your algorithm.

**Note:** Assume both the array and ArrayList of stock prices is not null and contains at least one element. You are allowed to use loops (for, while) for array and ArrayList traversal.
